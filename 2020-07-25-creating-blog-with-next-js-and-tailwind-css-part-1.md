# Creating a blog with Next.js and Tailwind CSS - Part 1

This is the most detailed a tutorial about this subject can be, because:

- It's my own blog being developed, not an example project
- I've just opened VS Code to my side monitor and have not yet even run `npm init`

Not a single detail will be left uncovered.

Here are the features I expect:

- Auto generate share images based on title
- RSS
- Dark theme
- Three main pages: home, posts, about
- Code highlighting
- Use `@tailwindcss/typography`
- Write posts in Markdown
- Best possible SEO

## Installing first dependencies

Before even starting to install, we need to initialize the git repo.

```sh
git init
```

The easiest way to start a Next.js project is using `npx`.

```sh
npx create-next-app .
```

It's the same process you would do with `create-react-app`, but for Next.js. The `.` in the end is actually the repository to create the new project, in this case, "just create it in the current directory".

It will offer to start from template, but in this case I'm going for the default.

```sh
? Pick a template Â» - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
>  Default starter app
   Example from the Next.js repo
```

After some time, we can install Tailwind CSS...

```sh
npm i tailwindcss @tailwindcss/typography
```

And create a config file

```sh
npx tailwindcss init
```

This will create a standard `tailwind.config.js`. While we're here, let's configure `purge` and `plugins`. Note that I didn't create any folder or file, but I'm already going to add what I expect to use in the future.

```js
module.exports = {
  purge: ['./pages/**/*.{js,mdx}', './components/**/*.js'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [require('@tailwindcss/typography')],
}
```

This is it for the project setup.
